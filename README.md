## Weather Conditions and Climate Change with ClimateWins part 2

### Objective
ClimateWins is a European nonprofit organization interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change in Europe. My task was to take advantage of unsupervised machine learning models in order to come up with ideas useful to predict the consequences of climate change in Europe. 

### Data
The dataset used comes from the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project, which is a collection of data gathered by meteorological stations located all over Europe. It can be found at this link: https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/da-spec-ml/Scripts/A1/Dataset-weather-prediction-dataset-processed.csv

### Executing the code
The code is available as a ipynb file in the "scripts" folder.
